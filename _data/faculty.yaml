  bio: >
    I am interested in the intersection between social and military history and especially in the social and cultural impact of warfare in Europe. I have worked on a wide-range of subjects, from German political culture and national identity, to POW and veterans’ affairs, to the role of film in illuminating historical consciousness. I am completing a book on the military career and anti-Semitic politics of Erich Ludendorff. I offer courses on European social, military, and film history. I can prepare graduate students in both German social and military history, or provide guidance to those interested in Europe as a primary or comparative field. I especially enjoy teaching comparative courses which seek to understand the way in which modern societies organize for and are transformed by war.

  bio: >
    I am a public historian who specializes in nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States cultural history. My research typically cuts across three fields: material culture studies, memory studies, and Public History. Simply put, I study how Americans have used objects over time—in museums, historical preservation, monument building, and in other contexts—to exert control over how all of us understand the past. Moreover, like other public historians working within universities, I study how historical meaning is made in public contexts by participating in history projects alongside community stakeholders. In all cases, my research seeks to answer questions such as: Why do we choose to remember some pasts and not others? Who decides what is remembered? How do those decisions influence our beliefs about nation and democracy? How are they reinforced over time? How are they challenged?

Watt is a member of the Temple Association of University Professionals, the Friends Association for Higher Education, the American Historical Association, and the American Academy of Religion. He served on one of the committees that drew up the American Academy of Religion's recently-issued Statement on Contingent Faculty Practices. The statement is, among other things, an effort to encourage members of the American Academy of Religion to reflect on the causes and consequences of universities' heavy reliance on contingent faculty. Most of Watt's articles and books focus on the history of religion in North America.  In A Transforming Faith, Watt examined the intellectual history of fundamentalism and evangelicalism in the middle decades of the twentieth century. In Bible-Carrying Christians, he used ethnographic research to rethink the relationship between religion and social power in Reagan's America. Along with Simon A. Wood, Watt edited a collection of original essays called Fundamentalism: Perspectives on a Contested History.  Those essays analyzed what scholars lose and gain when they deploy the concept of fundamentalism to analyze the religious practices and political activities of Christians, Jews and Muslims.  Together with Tracy Fessenden and Laura Levitt, Watt edits a book series sponsored by New York University Press -- North American Religions -- that highlights creative explorations of religious phenomena in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Anti-fundamentalism, Watt's analysis of Americans' responses to the invention of religious fundamentalism, will be published by Cornell University Press in 2017. Watt's current research focuses on liberal Quakers in the modern United States."

He received his M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1972) from the Uni¬versity of Chicago, majoring in history and specializing in India. His first trip to India was on a Fulbright Fellowship, 1964–66, and he has spent a total of some twelve years studying and teaching in India. He has also traveled widely throughout the United States, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. He has been a faculty member at Temple Uni¬versity since 1972, appointed Full Professor in 1984. He was awarded Temple’s Great Teacher designation in 1993. Spodek’s work in world history began in 1988 when he became Academic Director of a comprehensive, inno¬vative program working with teachers in the School Dis¬trict of Philadelphia to improve their knowledge base in world history and facilitate a rewriting of the world history program in the schools. Immediately following this program, he became principal investigator of a program that brought college professors and high-school teachers together to reconsider, revise, and, in many cases, initiate the teaching of world history in several of the colleges and universities in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Those projects led directly to the writing of The World’s History, a college-level textbook now entering into its fifth edition. Howard Spodek has published extensively on urbaniza¬tion in India, including Urban-Rural Integration in Regional Development (1976); Urban Form and Meaning in South-East Asia (editor, with Doris Srinivasan, 1993); Ahmedabad: Shock City of Twentieth Century India (2011); and a wide array of articles, including analyses of working women’s organiza¬tions. In addition, he wrote and produced the documentary film Ahmedabad (1983), and was the executive producer and subject specialist for the documentary film The Urban World: A Case Study of Slum Relocation in India (2013).

  expertise: "British History, British Empire History, Atlantic History, Eighteenth-Century History, Colonial British America"
  bio: >
    I have taught at Temple University since 2006, after receiving my PhD from Columbia University. I am the author of the book Mastering Christianity: Missionary Anglicanism and Slavery in the Atlantic World, which examines the attempts made by members of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) to convert enslaved people to Christianity and the impact this program had on wider debates about race, slavery, and abolition. My other publications include articles on the history of the eighteenth-century British Atlantic world that have appeared in the William and Mary Quarterly and the Journal of British Studies. My current book project examines the experiences of people around the British Empire who were neither ardent patriots nor ardent loyalists during the American Revolution. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in the history of Britain and the British Empire, Atlantic history, European history, and the history of slavery, among other subjects. I have received fellowships from the Huntington Library, the John Carter Brown Library, the Harvard University Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World, the Whiting Foundation, and a Beveridge Research Grant from the American Historical Association. I also currently serve as the Treasurer and a member of the Executive Committee of the North American Conference on British Studies.

  expertise: "Italy, Libya, Imperialism, Colonialism, Fascism, Mediterranean"
  bio: >
    I received a PhD from the History Department at Columbia University in the summer of 2013 after a long history of focusing on religious studies that led me to pursue a MA from the University of Chicago Divinity School and a BA in Religious Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My dissertation was entitled "Italy and the Sanusiyya: Negotiating Authority in Colonial Libya, 1911-1931," and it blended my interests by examining the relationship between Italian colonial officials and elite members of a Sufi Islamic tariqa or order in eastern Libya. Based on extensive research in Italian, Libyan, British, and French archives, my dissertation provides an innovative interpretation of the politics of resistance and collaboration in colonial Libya. Since completing the dissertation, my research has moved towards an examination of the introduction of the Fascist Party in the colonial setting. How did the rise of Mussolini reverberate in the Libyan territories? How did the colonies fit into the Fascist Party’s image of the Italian nation? These questions are guiding the process of revising my dissertation for publication. The Libyan territories provided a liminal national space for experimentation with the relationship between fascism and violence. At Temple, I teach a variety of courses concerning the role of Europe in the wider world. I have taught courses on European history in the twentieth century, the history of modern Italy, and courses on the process of imperialism and decolonization. I am currently developing a course on the modern history of the Mediterranean as a single geographic zone. This course will bring together my expertise in Italian history and the history of North Africa, and it will force us to rethink geo-political and cultural boundaries. At a time of increased immigration from North Africa to the southern shores of Europe, it is important for us to rethink the Mediterranean as a cohesive region instead of a line of division.
