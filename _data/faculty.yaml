  expertise: "Modern Germany, Military History, Film, World War One"
  bio: "I am interested in the intersection between social and military history and especially in the social and cultural impact of warfare in Europe. I have worked on a wide-range of subjects, from German political culture and national identity, to POW and veterans’ affairs, to the role of film in illuminating historical consciousness. I am completing a book on the military career and anti-Semitic politics of Erich Ludendorff. I offer courses on European social, military, and film history. I can prepare graduate students in both German social and military history, or provide guidance to those interested in Europe as a primary or comparative field. I especially enjoy teaching comparative courses which seek to understand the way in which modern societies organize for and are transformed by war."

  expertise: "Memory, Material Culture, Public History, U.S. Cultural History"
  bio: "I am a public historian who specializes in nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States cultural history. My research typically cuts across three fields: material culture studies, memory studies, and Public History. Simply put, I study how Americans have used objects over time—in museums, historical preservation, monument building, and in other contexts—to exert control over how all of us understand the past. Moreover, like other public historians working within universities, I study how historical meaning is made in public contexts by participating in history projects alongside community stakeholders. In all cases, my research seeks to answer questions such as: Why do we choose to remember some pasts and not others? Who decides what is remembered? How do those decisions influence our beliefs about nation and democracy? How are they reinforced over time? How are they challenged?"
