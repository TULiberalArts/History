## The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History
[The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History](http://www.cla.temple.edu/feinsteincenter/) supports innovative approaches to understanding American Jewish life. Its mission is simple: Inspiring Inquiry. In collaboration with institutions in Philadelphia and beyond, the FEINSTEIN CENTER invites the public to join conversations about Jewish culture, politics, history, and identity across time and space.
