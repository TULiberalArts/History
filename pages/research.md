## Research Centers

## [The Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy](http://www.temple.edu/cenfad/)

The Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD), founded in 1993 by Drs. Richard Immerman, Russell Weigley, and David Rosenberg, fosters interdisciplinary faculty and student research on the historic and contemporary use of force and diplomacy in a global context.

## [The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History](http://www.cla.temple.edu/feinsteincenter/)

The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History supports innovative approaches to understanding American Jewish life. Its mission is simple: Inspiring Inquiry. In collaboration with institutions in Philadelphia and beyond, the FEINSTEIN CENTER invites the public to join conversations about Jewish culture, politics, history, and identity across time and space.

## [Center for Public History](http://sites.temple.edu/centerforpublichistory/)

Center for Public History program combines a solid grounding in American history with practical training in non-profit heritage management. Students serve internships in the shadow of Independence Hall, wander the back rooms of our nation’s oldest museums, and explore new possibilities for digital pasts at some of the most historically significant sites in the United States.

## Dissent in America Teach-Ins

Evolving from Professor Ralph Young’s Dissent in America course and co-sponsored by the History Department and the History Honors Society Phi Alpha Theta, each Friday since September 2002 students gather to discuss the historical background to the current political situation in the world.

The Teach-ins are held Fridays, 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm, Anderson Hall 821.
