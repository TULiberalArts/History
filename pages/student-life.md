## Graduate Study at the University of Erfurt
![University of Erfurt]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resizederfurt.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
[Erfurt](https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-erfurt-germany/) is a stunning medieval city with winding streets and graceful market squares in the center of Germany, two hours by train from Frankfurt and Berlin.  Largely untouched by the bombing of World War II, Erfurt in a blend of old and new.  It is perhaps most famous as the place where Martin Luther studied as a young man.  In fact, the [monastery](https://europeforvisitors.com/germany/erfurt/erfurt-augustinerkloster.htm) where lived and prayed hundreds of years ago is still standing.

The [University of Erfurt](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/) sits just on the outskirts of town. With its six thousand students, it offers wide range of program in fields from public policy to education. One of the distinctive strengths of the university is its history department. Within the department, there is strong focus on [North American Studies](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/geschichte/north-american-history/). One of the advantages of this semester abroad program, then, is to study the United States outside of the United States. The department at Erfurt has three specialists in US history and regularly hosts visitors from around the world who study the US and offer classes and one-on-one instructions in Erfurt.  

There are two options for spending time in Erfurt. One is too spend a semester there as a visiting students. Because this is an officially exchange between Temple and Erfurt, your tuition costs would be exactly the same as if we were spending the semester in Philadelphia. Officials at Erfurt would help with housing option on that end. Second, each year the Temple History Department will send two graduate students to Erfurt to present their work and sit in on classes. Students have to apply for this option and will receive a grant to travel to Erfurt.  

### Sample Graduate Seminars
Below are samples of graduate seminars offered in recent years. All of these classes are taught in English. The readings are in English and the discussions are in English. (_**Note**_, the University also offers beginning and intermediate [courses](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/international/visiting-scholars/living-in-erfurt/language-courses/) in German.)

## The James A. Barnes Club
![James A. Barnes Club]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized James A Barnes logo.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
The purpose of the James A. Barnes Club is to foster a sense of community among the graduate students in the History Department. Graduate study is not only intellectually challenging (and rewarding), but emotionally draining as well. Coursework is intense, and graduate students in the History Department shuttle between Temple University’s Center City Campus (TUCC) and Main Campus; often without seeing a sympathetic fellow graduate student. All too often, graduate school can be an isolating, intimidating place. The Barnes Club works to change that.

Our organization is a support group for the concerns and issues that graduate students face each day. The Barnes Club serves as a vital liaison between graduate history students and the History Department, informing students about department events and voicing our concerns to the faculty. The Barnes Club email list distributes important information on department events and activities, conference and career opportunities, and Barnes Club social events to our members.
