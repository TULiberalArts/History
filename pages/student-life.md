History is happening all around you—not just in the classroom. College of Liberal Arts History degree students can join an association or [club](#he-james-a-barnes-club), work toward [awards or scholarships](#awards-and-scholarships), conduct research at the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy, and/or attend weekly [Teach-Ins](#dissent-in-america-teach-ins).

## Temple University History and Social Science Association (TUHSSA)

Temple University History and Social Science Association is the main undergraduate student group for History majors and minors. TUHSSA’s main objective is to serve undergraduate students interested in history, political science, and economics. We sponsor a lecture series, historical movie nights, panels for students, day trips to historical sites and much more. TUHSSA also provides a tutoring service, and publishes an annual Undergraduate History Journal. In addition, TUHSSA works closely with CENFAD, the Dissent in America Teach-Ins and the history honors program.

## The James A. Barnes Club
![James A. Barnes Club]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized James A Barnes logo.png){:.img-right}
The purpose of the James A. Barnes Club is to foster a sense of community among the graduate students in the History Department. Graduate study is not only intellectually challenging (and rewarding), but emotionally draining as well. Coursework is intense, and graduate students in the History Department shuttle between Temple University’s Center City Campus (TUCC) and Main Campus; often without seeing a sympathetic fellow graduate student. All too often, graduate school can be an isolating, intimidating place. The Barnes Club works to change that.

Our organization is a support group for the concerns and issues that graduate students face each day. The Barnes Club serves as a vital liaison between graduate history students and the History Department, informing students about department events and voicing our concerns to the faculty. The Barnes Club email list distributes important information on department events and activities, conference and career opportunities, and Barnes Club social events to our members.

## Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) Awards
The Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) awards several additional fellowships and grants. They include:

**Thomas J. Davis Endowed Fellowship in Diplomacy and Foreign Relations**
This fellowship is made possible by the generosity of Todd Davis, who received his Ph.D. in History from Temple in 2002 and served as the first graduate assistant for development for the Center for the Study of Diplomacy (CENFAD). Todd named the fellowship after his father, a decorated first lieutenant in the U.S. Army who was killed in action during the Vietnam War.  Responsibilities will be dedicated to advancing the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy. In this capacity, your assignment will be primarily to assist, through research and writing, applications for external grants to support CENFAD’s projects. You will also be expected to assist in the publication of CENFAD’s newsletter, Strategic Visions, help publicize lectures and symposia, administrate CENFAD’s website, coordinate CENFAD colloquia and other events, and contribute in parallel ways. As is the case with a conventional assistantship, you will not be expected to work more than 20 hours per week. The fellowship Includes a stipend — amount changes each year.

**Sergeant Major William F. Berger Prize Endowed Fellowship for War and Society**
This fellowship is made possible by the generosity of Joseph Eble, who received his M.A. in History from Temple in 1997. Joe previously earned a graduate degree from the U.S. Naval War College in National Security and Strategic Studies and served in the U.S. Navy for 21 years before retiring as a commander. He named the fellowship after his father-in-law, a decorated sergeant major in the U.S. Army who fought in both World War II and Vietnam. Responsibilities will be dedicated to advancing the History Department’s concentration in War and Society, a vital dimension of the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD). You will fulfill this responsibility primarily as a teaching assistant in the introductory course in War and Society, History C063. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to the development of a more extensive curriculum in War and Society. As is the case with a conventional assistantship, you will not be expected to work more than 20 hours per week. The prize includes a stipend.
