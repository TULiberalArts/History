## Program Overview

Located in Philadelphia, close to Washington, D.C. and New York City, amidst a host of major historical research collections, the History Department at Temple offers graduate study in a range of historical subjects and time periods.  Our students have gone on to jobs at major research universities, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, government historical offices, museums, archives, and other private and public institutions. Our department is internationally renown, in particular, for the study of military history, environmental history, transnational history, diplomatic history, cultural history, early American history, and recent United States history.

The department houses several intellectual forums and resources.  Our in-house research center, the Center for Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) regularly sponsors invited talks and major conferences; it supports graduate student travel and research through various grants and awards. The Center for Public History trains graduate students, sponsors public history initiatives, and maintains extensive relationships with Philadelphia-area museums and historical sites. Through the Global United States Study program (GUSS) the History Department coordinates international graduate student workshops and sponsors graduate student exchanges with the University of Angers (France), the University of East Anglia (England), and numerous other non-US universities, affording our graduate students the opportunity to study and teach abroad.

The history graduate program at Temple aims to give students a broad and deep understanding of major historiographical questions while allowing them to move efficiently toward their professional and career goals.

## Programs of Study

### M.A in History

The M.A. program is designed to provide graduate students with a strong foundation in both historical knowledge and in the methods of historical research. The program prepares students for doctoral programs, provides graduate level training for educators, promotes expertise in public history, and serves students who majored in history and who wish to continue their training at the M.A. level. The structure of the program allows students to concentrate their coursework in one geographical area (as defined below) while also taking courses in other geographical regions and in historical methods. Currently, the department is able to offer funding to some students whose work focuses on public history; it does not offer funding to students who concentrate in other fields.

### Concentration in Public History

MA students in Temple’s 2-year [Public History concentration](http://sites.temple.edu/centerforpublichistory/files/2014/04/MAPublicHistorysequence1.pdf) choose from a variety of advanced graduate courses in American history accompanied by specialized Public History courses. Every Public History course is built around a significant community-engagement project. And every student acquires real-world experience through a host of internships hosted throughout the Philadelphia area.

Applications for fall admission must be submitted by February 15. Applicants must indicate their intent to concentrate in Public History. A limited number of tuition waivers and fellowships are awarded each year to the most qualified applicants. Please contact the [Director of Public History](mailto:hilowe@temple.edu) for additional information about application requirements and funding opportunities.
