## Learn in Philadelphia - Amidst a Host of Major Historical Research Collections
![History Graduate]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized history major.png){:.img-right}
The History Department at Temple offers graduate study in a range of historical subjects and time periods. Our students have gone on to jobs at major research universities, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, government historical offices, museums, archives and other private and public institutions. The Department offers full-time graduate programs leading to a master’s (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees. We offer several four-year graduate teaching assistantships to incoming doctoral students and a variety of funding packages to master’s students in public history. Additionally, the University offers fellowships on a competitive basis. Our department is internationally renown, in particular, for the study of military history, environmental history, transnational history, diplomatic history, cultural history, early American history, and recent United States history.

The department houses several intellectual forums and resources. Our in-house research center, the Center for Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) regularly sponsors invited talks and major conferences; it supports graduate student travel and research through various grants and awards. [The Center for Public History](http://sites.temple.edu/centerforpublichistory/) trains graduate students, sponsors public history initiatives, and maintains extensive relationships with Philadelphia-area museums and historical sites. Through the Global United States Study program (GUSS) the History Department coordinates international graduate student workshops and sponsors graduate student exchanges with the University of Angers (France), the University of East Anglia (England), and numerous other non-US universities, affording our graduate students the opportunity to study and teach abroad.

The history graduate program at Temple aims to give students a broad and deep understanding of major historiographical questions while allowing them to move efficiently toward their professional and career goals. Graduates of the M.A. and Ph.D. programs in history work at numerous colleges and universities in tenured and tenure-track positions, as historians for the federal and state governments, in museums, university presses, and as university administrators.

## M.A in History
The M.A. program is designed to provide graduate students with a strong foundation in both historical knowledge and in the methods of historical research. The program prepares students for doctoral programs, provides graduate level training for educators, promotes expertise in public history, and serves students who majored in history and who wish to continue their training at the M.A. level. The structure of the program allows students to concentrate their coursework in one geographical area (as defined below) while also taking courses in other geographical regions and in historical methods. Currently, the department is able to offer funding to some students whose work focuses on public history; it does not offer funding to students who concentrate in other fields.

## Concentration in Public History
![Public History]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized history graduate.png){:.img-right}
MA students in Temple’s 2-year Public History concentration choose from a variety of advanced graduate courses in American history accompanied by specialized Public History courses. Every Public History course is built around a significant community-engagement project. And every student acquires real-world experience through a host of internships hosted throughout the Philadelphia area.

Applicants must indicate their intent to concentrate in Public History. A limited number of tuition waivers and fellowships are awarded each year to the most qualified applicants. Please contact the [Director of Public History](mailto:hilowe@temple.edu) for additional information about application requirements and funding opportunities. **Applications for fall admission must be submitted by February 15.**

## Ph.D. in History
The History Department’s Ph.D. program is a vibrant, engaged intellectual community of scholars and students. We work across all historical periods and methodologies. The thrust of the Ph.D. program is to prepare professional historians who are equipped to function in either academia or in public history.

## Admissions Process
Please visit the [History Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/history) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## Teaching Assistantships
Teaching Assistants (TA) are required to teach or assist in teaching at Temple. Their duties include 20 hours of service per week. Holders receive tuition waivers for all courses taken during the fall and spring semesters (up to 9 credits) that contribute to the student’s program, plus a stipend. All TAs are doctoral students.

Most Teaching Assistants are assigned to large core courses in which they are given the responsibility to lead discussion sections, grade papers and examinations, prepare and deliver formal lectures, and contribute to structuring the syllabus for the course. On occasion a Teaching Assistant is provided the opportunity to teach her/his own course, serve as a Research Assistant for one of the faculty in the department, or take on some administrative responsibility consistent with the student’s program. Teaching Assistantships can be renewed for up to four years. Decisions regarding TAships are made annually in the spring semester. New applicants for the PhD program are automatically considered. Advanced PhD students who do not currently hold a TAship and who wish to be considered for one should send their application to the Chair of the History department by January 31.

## University-Awarded Fellowships
Presidential, University, and Future Faculty Fellowships are administered by the Graduate School and provide support for a maximum of four calendar years with stipends higher than those of assistantships. They are intended as part of a four-year program that includes two years’ experience as a Teaching/Research Assistant. In addition to free tuition, these fellowships carry a stipend for a 12-month year. (The stipend is reduced if the student is not at Temple in the summer.) Normally, the student is on fellowship her/his first two years in the program, and serves as an assistant in the third and fourth years. While on fellowship, the student must take a minimum of 9 academic credits each semester during the academic year. Students are nominated for Presidential, University, and Future Faculty Fellowships by the department.

## Dissertation Completion Grant
Each semester the Graduate Council may nominate between one and three Ph.D. students to receive a University Dissertation Completion Grant. Departmental nomination does not guarantee the nominee receipt of the Dissertation Completion Grant. Receipt of this grant disqualifies a student from receiving additional financial support from Temple University.

## Appointment as Part-Time Instructor
Ph.D. candidates are eligible for appointment as part-time instructors. The Department Chair, after consulting with the Director of Graduate Studies, is responsible for these appointments. S/he will consider whether the candidate has assisted in the course, and if so, consult the faculty whom s/he has assisted. Priority will be given to those qualified students who have not had the opportunity previously to teach independently. 

## Annual Conference
Graduate students in the Department of History at Temple University host the James A. Barnes Club Graduate Student Conference annually. The Barnes Club Conference is one of the largest and most prestigious graduate student conferences in the region, drawing participants from across the nation and around the world. The annual two-day conference takes place in March during the spring semester.  It gives rising scholars the opportunity to present their projects, receive critical feedback, and network to establish and expand their academic communities. Select conference papers are awarded cash prizes in various geographical and scholarly categories.
