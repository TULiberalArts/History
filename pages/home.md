Using rigorous standards of evidence, historians tell meaningful stories about the past. In depth historical study gives students important tools for understanding contemporary issues affecting their own lives as well as local, national, and global events. The Department of History includes over 30 faculty members, 400 History majors, and more than 100 M.A. and Ph.D. students. We train executives, lawyers, politicians, educators, preservationists, and tomorrowâ€™s historians. Rich regional resources and acclaimed research centers ensure Temple a prominent voice in global conversations about the past.

History students develop skills useful for any career that requires high-level critical thinking, wide-ranging analytical skills, and great writing. Our students learn to master large amounts of information, conduct in-depth research, contextualize evidence from a variety of sources, and craft powerful written and oral arguments. These strengths are a foundation for lifelong learning, civic engagement, and successful careers.
