Using rigorous standards of evidence, historians tell meaningful stories about the past. In depth historical study gives students important tools for understanding contemporary issues affecting their own lives as well as local, national, and global events.

History students develop skills useful for any career that requires high-level critical thinking, wide-ranging analytical skills, and great writing. Our students learn to master large amounts of information, conduct in-depth research, contextualize evidence from a variety of sources, and craft powerful written and oral arguments. These strengths are a foundation for lifelong learning, civic engagement, and successful careers.
