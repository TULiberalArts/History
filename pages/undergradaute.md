## Internationally Recognized Faculty

Our faculty members are both world-renowned scholars and award-winning teachers.

## Exciting Coursework

Our majors take rigorous courses in subjects such as Dissent in America, The History of Nazi Germany, the History of Philadelphia, Immigration and the American Dream, and Cold War Africa. We have faculty experts in urban history, Asian history, military history, diplomacy, imperialism, the environment, and many other fields.

## The Cradle Of American History And Its Global Connections

Our home, Philadelphia, is a terrific place to study history — not only of the city and its remarkable past, but of the world as well. Our courses take advantage of Philly’s exciting past and our major allows students to take advantage of the many study abroad options available at Temple.

## Degrees and Programs of Study

### Major in History

The history major consists of a step approach. Courses numbered 0800 through 1999 are introductory level; courses numbered 2000-2999 are intermediate level, and courses numbered 3000-4999 are advanced level. Courses with “9″ as a second digit are honors courses and are usually restricted to honors students.

The history major requires 12 courses (36 credits). Students must take two introductory level courses, of which one is selected from courses numbered 0800-1099 and one from courses numbered 1100-1999. Three courses (9 credits) are required at the 2000 level. Four courses are required at the 3000 level, of which one must be a writing intensive course (ending in -96, -97, or -98), which students should take during the junior year. The 3000-level writing course is a prerequisite for the required 4000-level capstone-writing seminar (ending in -96, -97, or -98). The 4000-level capstone class should be taken during the senior year. Finally, students may select two history courses (6 credits) at any level.

Within these broad requirements, students must complete a minimum of two courses in U.S. history, two courses in European history, and three courses in Asian, African, Latin American or Global/Comparative history. Two of the courses in any category or level must be predominantly pre-1900 in content.

Students should take four courses that represent an area of concentration based on some geographic or thematic intellectual rationale. The area of concentration should be defined in writing and approved by a departmental advisor ideally at the start of the junior year and no later than the start of the senior year.

### Minor in History

A History minor is an ideal complement to other majors and programs at Temple, from medicine to journalism, from computer science to finance, from film to marketing. Students with a minor in history are required to take six (6) courses totaling eighteen (18) semester hours. Of the six courses, at least two (2) must be numbered 2000 or above and at least one course (1) must be numbered 3000 or above.

###  Curriculum

History courses impart a range of valuable skills while also providing a lively forum for the discussion of ideas. While some courses are lecture-based, most classes blend lectures with discussions and debates. Along the way, History students learn important skills such as how to read for argument, how to conduct research, and how to articulate an idea and support it with evidence. Perhaps equally importantly, History students learn how to think critically and to formulate their own thoughts on a given topic.
