  <summary><strong>Program Requirements</strong></summary>
<blockquote>  
  <p>  
  The heart of the History Honors Scholar Program is the thesis, which gives students an opportunity to undertake in-depth historical 
  research and writing on a topic of their own choosing. In doing this, they are mentored by faculty in the History Department and part 
  of a cohort of other engaged and talented students undertaking their own research projects. The final version of the thesis will be
  required to be between 7000 and 10000 words, not including notes and bibliography. This is approximately the length of articles
  published in academic history journals. Students will also present on their work.
  </p>
</blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>  
    <p>  
   The program runs on an annual basis and participants take two, three-credit courses during a single academic year. In the Fall 
   semester, students take History 4934 “Honors Historiography and Research Methods.” In this course, students develop their thesis 
   topics and work on researching them in primary and secondary sources. In the Spring semester, students take History 4997 “Honors 
   Thesis Seminar”. In this course, students complete their research and write, revise, and present their final thesis. Both of these
   courses are required for program participants and there are no substitutions possible. Completing History 4997 and the honors thesis 
   fulfills the “Capstone” writing requirement for History Majors. History majors need to separately fulfill the “Intermediate” writing 
   requirement for major, typically before they participate in the History Honors Scholar Program.
