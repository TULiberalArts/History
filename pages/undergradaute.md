## Internationally Recognized Faculty

Our faculty members are both world-renowned scholars and award-winning teachers.

## Exciting Coursework

Our majors take rigorous courses in subjects such as Dissent in America, The History of Nazi Germany, the History of Philadelphia, Immigration and the American Dream, and Cold War Africa. We have faculty experts in urban history, Asian history, military history, diplomacy, imperialism, the environment, and many other fields.

## The Cradle Of American History And Its Global Connections

Our home, Philadelphia, is a terrific place to study history — not only of the city and its remarkable past, but of the world as well. Our courses take advantage of Philly’s exciting past and our major allows students to take advantage of the many study abroad options available at Temple.
